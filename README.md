# AI-chatbot

Hello here I am creating a simple python chatbot that is highly customizable using deep learning tensorflow.

To try this project simply download zip file. Make sure you have all the imports mentioned in the project installed in python using pip. Then simply go to chatbot.py and execute the file.

# Running the bot!

Because I run my program on a Windows 10 machine, I had to download a server called Xming. If you run your program and it gives you some weird errors about the program failing, you can download Xming.
Before you run your program, you need to make sure you install python or python3 with pip (or pip3). If you are unfamiliar with command line commands, check out the resources below.
Once you run your program, you should get this.
